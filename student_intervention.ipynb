In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "* **Naive Bayes**\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Naive Bayes is very prominently used as a text classification algorithm, for example spam / not spam filter (reference : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering)\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Naive Bayes is a High bias classifiers hence it can converge very quickly on low amount of data. It also works well when primarliy categorical or discrete features are present in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Naive Bayes have following weaknesses:\n",
    "    - It makes assumption of independance between features which is not always true in real world datasets.\n",
    "    - It is prone to overfitting as there is no regularization.\n",
    "    \n",
    "d. From my understanding of the dataset Naive Bayes is a good candidate as it is a high bias classifier which works well with low amount of data. In our dataset we have only 300 data points and features are mostly categorical making naive bayes a good candidate for the task of classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SVM**\n",
    "\n",
    "a. SVM's before deep learning systems were the state of the art optimum classifiers for many machine learning tasks (reference : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering)\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Just like Naive Bayes classifier SVM is also a high bias classfier and hence works good with small data sets. The SVM provides theoretical guarantees in providing optimal decision boundaries. Also through kernel trick it can learn non-linear decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Naive Bayes have following weaknesses:\n",
    "    - Only allows binary classification\n",
    "    - No probabilistic confidence for its classification predictions\n",
    "    \n",
    "d. Just like Naive Bayes SVM is a good fit as it is also a high bias classifier and hence require less number of features. We can learn both linear and non-linear decision boundaries using SVM hence we can try kernel as hyperparameter while training the model to check what kind of decision boundary is suitable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logistic Regression** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Logistic Regression is widely used in Finance Based Companies where it is used to make classifications on financial data. A perfect example is a system described in this paper (http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1152&context=jhfm)\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Logistic Regression allows to use lots of ways to regularize your model which avoids it from over fitting. Unlike Naive Bayes it does not make assumptions of independance. Unlike SVM and Decision TREE it has nice probablistic interpretations for the predictions it is making. Through the regularization parameter we can control the bias and variance of the classfier, hence making it a possible candidate for small sized dataset like ours.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Logistic Regression will not work when prediction variable is continuous. Also it performs bad when there is correlation between features. For this we would do feature selection and normalization in later sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. So far we have selected 2 parametric models, both of them are high bias classifier, SVM can learn both linear and non-linear decision boundaries. The only possibility left was a classifier with capacity to not overfit the data. Logistic Regression with regularization would allow us to do that hence it is selected for the purpose of this task.\n"
